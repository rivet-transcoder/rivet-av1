//! The AV1 encoder: key frames and inter frames.
//!
//! Each frame is coded by the decoder's own tile walker running in encode
//! mode (see `encoder::tile`): the encoder plants its decisions — the
//! partition, modes, motion vector and quantised levels of each block —
//! and the walker codes them with the normative contexts and CDF
//! adaptation while reconstructing exactly as the decoder will. The frame
//! header is written, then parsed back with the decoder's parser, so the
//! two cannot disagree; the in-loop filters and the reference update are
//! the decoder's.
//!
//! Decisions are searched by trial coding (`encoder::rdo`); the in-loop
//! filters' parameters (loop filter levels, CDEF strengths) are searched on
//! a first pass's reconstruction, and the frame is then coded again
//! replaying the first pass's decisions with them.
